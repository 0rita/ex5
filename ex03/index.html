    <p><b>Donkey</b> is a <ins>fictional character</ins> created by <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Steig" title="William Steig">William Steig</a> and adapted by
      <abbr title="DreamWorks Animation">DWA.</abbr> (DreamWorks Animation) for the <i>Shrek</i> franchise. He is
      voiced primarily by Eddie Murphy. Donkey is an anthropomorphic donkey and his appearance is modeled after a
      miniature donkey named Perry. He is depicted with grey fur, brown eyes, and a black mane. In the franchise, he
      is the sidekick and best friend of Shrek, husband to Dragon, and father to a litter of Dronkeys.
    </p>
    <p>As the series' comic relief character, Donkey is well-regarded by critics for his wit, wisdom, and humor,
      although he has been accused of embodying harmful racial stereotypes due to his design and role in the films.

      <h3><i>Shrek</i> (2001)</h3>

      <img id="img2001" src="images/2001.webp" height="250px" alt="">

      <p>Donkey made his debut in the 2001 film <i>Shrek</i> at a sale of mythical characters from old fairy tales,
        being sold to the evil Lord Farquaad's knights. Donkey's special power was his ability to talk, which his owner,
        an old woman, tried to capitalize on. Following a lucky escape, he befriends <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrek" title="Shrek (character)">Shrek</a>, who, although annoyed by
        Donkey's non-stop chatter, slowly and reluctantly develops an affection for him.
      </p>
      <p>Donkey requests to stay with Shrek since he has no one else. At first, Shrek refuses, before finally giving in,
        although he only allows him to stay outside of his house for one night. Donkey denies any involvement when Shrek
        finds all the creatures from fairy tales living in his swamp. The monsters admit that Lord Farquaad drove them
        out of that location. Donkey is the only one who is prepared to lead him, and since he knows where Farquaad is,
        Shrek decides to accompany him.

        <p>However, when they arrive, Farquaad has his men try to kill <em>Shrek</em> in an arena to find the perfect
          champion to find and bring him back Princess Fiona, whom he wants to make his bride. Donkey and Shrek defeat
          Farquaad's men, and Farquaad decides to have Shrek be his champion instead. However, Shrek shows no interest
          and
          only demands his swamp back. When Farquaad offers Shrek a deal to return him his swamp if he agrees to go on
          the
          quest, Shrek agrees, and Donkey follows Shrek on his quest to find Fiona. While coming to the castle, Donkey
          unintentionally catches the unwanted attention of the fire-breathing dragon guarding the Princess.
        </p>

        <p>Shrek escapes, but Donkey is caught and cornered. Before the dragon attempts to doom him, he tries to avoid
          his
          fate by complimenting the dragon, whom he discovers is a female, and the dragon is greatly flattered by
          Donkey's
          compliments. She takes him to her lair to be intimate with him. However, Shrek rescues Donkey before things
          become too personal, and the two narrowly escape with the Princess before the dragon catches up.
        </p>
        <p>One night, during camp, Donkey asks Shrek why he hates everyone so much, and Shrek angrily reveals that
          everyone judges him as a scary monster before getting to know him. Donkey acknowledges that he already knew
          that
          there was more to Shrek's character when they met. Donkey begins to notice a romance between Fiona and Shrek,
          despite their denials. The next night, Donkey goes inside a windmill to talk to the Princess, only to discover
          that she becomes an ogre herself after sunset. Shrek overhears them talking and misinterprets the conversation
          as Fiona insulting him. The next day, Shrek berates her for what she supposedly said, and Lord Farquaad comes
          to
          take her.
        </p>
        <p>Donkey tries to clarify the whole situation to Shrek, who also angrily insults him. Hurt and enraged, Donkey
          claims his half of the swamp for his hard work helping him. The two get into a heated argument, whereupon
          Donkey
          finally explains that Fiona did not say that Shrek was ugly, and the two reconcile. Donkey then has the
          dragon,
          whom he reconnected with earlier, take him and Shrek to Fiona's wedding, where the dragon devours Farquaad.
          After Shrek saves Fiona, Donkey sings "I'm a Believer" at Shrek and Fiona's wedding reception and takes his
          love, Dragon, as his wife. On <i>Shrek in the Swamp Karaoke Dance Party!</i>, he sings "Baby Got Back" by Sir
          Mix-a-Lot.

      <img id="img2004" src="images/2004.jpg" height="250px" alt="">
      <p>Donkey first appears in the film, having been remaining at Shrek's house while Shrek and Fiona were away on
        their
        honeymoon. When they return, Shrek tells Donkey to leave, but Donkey is hesitant. Fiona suggests that he should
        return for Dragon's sake, but he then reveals that he is having troubles in his relationship with Dragon as she
        was acting strangely, but he could not determine the cause, so he decides to move back in with them. However,
        Shrek makes him leave.
      </p>
      <p>As Shrek and Fiona begin to have a moment, Donkey abruptly returns and interrupts, claiming that a chariot of
        royal men has arrived. A messenger appears and tells the newlywed couple that Fiona's parents have invited them
        to
        a royal ball to celebrate their marriage, as well as for her father to give his royal blessing. Shrek is
        completely hesitant to accept, as he knows that her parents will never accept them as Ogres, though he
        eventually
        gives up and goes. He and Fiona are accompanied by Donkey to the Far Far Away kingdom, who repeatedly asks, "Are
        we there yet?" Shrek and Fiona keep answering no.

        <p>He then meets Puss in Boots and becomes jealous, as he is spending a lot of time with Shrek. By the end of
          the
          film, they are great friends. At one point in the film, he reveals that he was the donkey traded by Jack for
          the
          magic beans, which greatly offended him. He and Shrek ended up drinking the "Happily Ever After" potion from
          the
          Fairy Godmother's workshop and while Shrek transformed into a handsome human, Donkey became a magnificently
          bred
          and handsome white stallion (albeit with the same buck teeth and voice, and on the bottle it read that the
          potion
          is not for those with nervous disorders, after which Shrek and everyone else stares at Donkey as it is
          strongly
          hinted that Donkey has one, but he remains clueless as to the reason of why everyone is staring at him).
        </p>
        <p>Shrek and Puss ride Donkey back to the castle. When Shrek goes inside, Fiona (who had also changed back to
          human
          form) comes running out to find Shrek. Donkey then explains why they changed, and that Shrek went inside
          looking
          for her. However, Shrek comes back outside heartbroken after Fiona went back in, as Charming and Fairy
          Godmother
          beat them both to it: Charming tricking Fiona into thinking he is Shrek, and Fairy Godmother convincing Shrek
          that
          Fiona is better off with Charming. Shrek, Donkey and Puss lament in a bar called the Poison Apple, only to
          discover Fiona's father Harold secretly talking to Fairy Godmother, revealing the scam. Unfortunately, they
          are
          both caught when Donkey's talking habits cause him to accidentally blurt out, completely exposing them. They
          are
          eventually caught and captured by Godmother's men and are arrested. However, the other fairy tale creatures
          witness this and break them out, and Gingy has the Muffin Man create a giant, Godzilla-sized Gingerbread man
          called Mongo, whom Donkey helps lead to the castle. They succeed in getting in, but Mongo is defeated by the
          castle's guards.
        </p>
        <p>After the trio finished their mission with victory, both Donkey and Shrek return to their normal forms.
          Donkey
          seemed to be quite disappointed at returning to his original form, although Shrek told Donkey he still sees
          Donkey
          as a noble steed. Donkey later sings "Livin' la Vida Loca" along with Puss during the party. After the
          credits,
          Donkey and Dragon are reunited, and he meets their newborn children, Dronkeys. Upon seeing his new kids,
          Donkey
          ends up exclaiming: "I gotta get a job!". He later sings "Disco Inferno" on Far Far Away Idol.
